Someone figure out sticky navbar, I gave up on that

It's commented on line 81 in styles.css file

The only div you'll need is topnav, the js was already done by Lalasa

On applying that line 81 thingy, divs start overlapping. So try to figure that out


Next,

Create the facutly page. It's similar to index.html.
Copy the same code. 
Changes to be done are - 
    Show Mark Attendance and Update Attendance in the transitions. So, Create proper logos. Link is in disc
    Then Lalasa Insert your codes there
